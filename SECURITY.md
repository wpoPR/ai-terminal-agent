# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We only support security fixes for the latest released version and the `main`
branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for security reports.

Use GitHub Security Advisories:
https://github.com/wesleyoliveira/ai-terminal-agent/security/advisories

If you cannot use advisories, contact the maintainer via their GitHub profile.

We will acknowledge receipt as soon as possible and provide an update when a
fix is available.
